Appointment Booking System -
This is a full-stack appointment booking application built with Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and React for the frontend. It allows businesses to manage their services and availability, and customers to book appointments easily.

How it Works

1. Business owner creates a business, adds services, and sets availability slots.
2. Customer selects a business, chooses a service, picks a valid slot, and books an appointment.
3. The system validates the selected time and ensures no conflicts with existing appointments.
4. Both business and customer can manage appointments through their dashboards.
